Excellent article on cancer. Pass it on.<br>
<br>
AFTER YEARS OF TELLING PEOPLE CHEMOTHERAPY IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRY AND ELIMINATE 
CANCER, &nbsp;JOHNS&nbsp;HOPKINS&nbsp;IS FINALLY STARTING TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN&nbsp;ALTERNATIVE 
WAY. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Cancer Update from Johns&nbsp;Hopkins&nbsp;:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up 
in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion. When doctors 
tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after 
treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because 
they have not reached the detectable size.<br>
<br>
2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed 
and prevented from multiplying and forming tumours.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional 
deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental,<br>
food and lifestyle factors.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
5.. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and 
including supplements will strengthen the immune system.&nbsp;</font></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4"><i>&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000"> <b>
(consuming vitamins and other nutritional supplements will feed cancer cells and 
must be avoided)</b></font></i></font><i><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
</span></font></b><span lang="EN-AU" style="color: black">
<br>
6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also 
destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow,<br>
gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, 
heart, lungs etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy 
cells, tissues and organs.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumour 
size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not<br>
result in more tumour destruction.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the 
immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence<br>
the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.<br>
<br>
10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become 
resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to 
spread to other sites.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not 
feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.&nbsp;</span><b><span style="color: #FF0000">(vitamins 
and other nutritional supplements are highly concentrated acidic nutrition which 
feeds cancer cells and must be avoided)</span></b><span lang="EN-AU" style="color: black"><b><br>
</b>
<br>
<br>
WHAT CANCER CELLS FEED ON:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food 
supply to the cancer cells. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal,Spoonful 
etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would 
be Manuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts. Table salt has a 
chemical added to make it white in colour. Better alternative is Bragg's aminos 
or sea salt.&nbsp;<br>
</span>
</font></i><span lang="EN-AU" style="color: black"><font size="4"><br>
</font><i><font size="4">b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in 
the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and<br>
substituting with unsweetened soya milk, cancer cells are being starved.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and 
it is best to eat fish, and a little chicken rather than beef or pork. Meat also 
contains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all 
harmful, especially to people with cancer.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and 
a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline<br>
environment. &nbsp;About 20% can be from cooked food including beans. Fresh vegetable 
juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach<br>
down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to no urish and enhance growth of 
healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try<br>
and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including bean sprouts) and eat 
some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at<br>
temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high caffeine. Green tea is a 
better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties.Water-&nbsp;</font></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF0000">
(pure filtered water and natural teas are good for the body they are alkaline in 
nature)</font></b></i></font><i><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
</span></font></b><span lang="EN-AU" style="color: black">
<br>
<br>
12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. 
Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrefied<br>
and leads to more toxic build-up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or 
eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of<br>
cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence, Essiac, 
anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the<br>
body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin 
E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal 
method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.<b>&nbsp;</b></span><b><span style="color: #FF0000">(nutrients 
and vitamins obtained from eating regular foods will help the immune system 
while the concentrated nutritional supplements and vitamins will feed cancer 
cells.&nbsp; )</span></b><font color="#FF0000"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-AU" style="color: black">
<br>
15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive 
spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger,<br>
unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic 
environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax<br>
and enjoy life.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, 
and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular<br>
level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells.<br>
